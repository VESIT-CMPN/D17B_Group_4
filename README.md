IDS in Cloud Computing

With increase in use of cloud servers in the technology industry we should ensure that there is no threat on our data which is stored in the cloud server or no threat on the website which is hosted on the cloud server. When non legitimate user use our server or make changes in our system, those changes must be known to us. For this purpose, We have implemented intrusion detection using Tripwire which is a host based IDS for ubuntu, which helps us in tracking the changes made to the file system.
We implemented this project on DigitalOcean.
